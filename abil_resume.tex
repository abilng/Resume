           The Rectilinear Steiner Tree Problem (RSMT) asks for a minimum length tree that interconnects a given set of points by only horizontal and vertical line segments, enabling the use of extra points. There are various exact algorithms. However the problem is NP-complete. The scope of the work is to implement a proven exact algorithm. Implemented FDP (Fast Dynamic Programming) Algorithm For RSMT by Ganley \& Cohoon which is based on Hwangâ€™s theorem\\\\
